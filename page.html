	It was established in 1993 as a joint venture of two Dutch potato processing producers: Farm Frites and Aviko. A factory was built and a line of French fries initiated in the autumn of 1994, within twelve months  of the start of construction.
	The decision to locate the factory in Lębork was influenced by the favourable climate and appropriate soil conditions classified as "First Zone for Healthy Potatoes". An added bonus was Lębork authorities' positive approach to the venture which they recognized as a development opportunity for the town.

	Initially, FFP employed 80 workers, including a few specialists from Holland who were responsible for implementing the  international production standards and for training their Polish successors. The annual potato processing amounted to 40.000 tons.

	In July 2004, a new line for potato pancakes was introduced and in July 2011, a new line for potato flakes. Currently, three modern production lines enable the factory to process around 60 different types of product, which find their way to the tables of individual consumers and restaurants in numerous European countries and beyond.<br />
	At present, there are 211 people working at Farm Frites Poland SA, and the amount of potatoes used for production annually exceeds 200.000 tons.

With the experience and strong technical support we have at hand, and our wonderful workforce, we are confident we will be able to satisfy the evolving needs of customers expectations												</p>

		Farm Frites is one of FFP's two shareholders. The company was established in 1971 in Oudenhoorn in the Netherlands by Gerrit de Bruijne. Initially the plant produced 700 tons of fresh French fries annually. In 1975, following further investments, production increased to 7.500 tons annually and it has been rising ever since. Other key events - impacting the development of  Farm Frites in the world - were the establishement of a joint venture enterprise in Egypt in 1989, starting business in Argentina in 1996 and setting up a strategic alliance in 1999 with Simplot, the US potato processor.

						<p>
		Currently, Piet de Bruijne, son of Gerrit, iheads this ever independent and family run company. With its 8 production plants (in Europe, Egypt and Argentina) and 17 sales offices (e.g. in China, Guatemala, Brasil and Poland), Farm Frites employs 1.800 people and sells its products to over 40 countries around the world.
